``gplearn`` implements Genetic Programming in Python, with a
`scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org>`_ inspired and compatible API.

While Genetic Programming (GP) can be used to perform a
`very wide variety of tasks <http://www.genetic-programming.org/combined.php>`_,
``gplearn`` is purposefully constrained to solving symbolic regression
problems. This is motivated by the scikit-learn ethos, of having powerful
estimators that are straight-forward to implement.

Symbolic regression is a machine learning technique that aims to identify an
underlying mathematical expression that best describes a relationship. It
begins by building a population of naive random formulas to represent a
relationship between known independent variables and their dependent variable
targets in order to predict new data. Each successive generation of programs is
then evolved from the one that came before it by selecting the fittest
individuals from the population to undergo genetic operations.

``gplearn`` retains the familiar scikit-learn ``fit``/``predict`` API and
works with the existing scikit-learn `pipeline <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html>`_
and `grid search <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html>`_
modules. You can get started with ``gplearn`` as simply as::

    est = SymbolicRegressor()
    est.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = est.predict(X_test)

However, don't let that stop you from exploring all the ways that the evolution
can be tailored to your problem. The package attempts to squeeze a lot of
functionality into a scikit-learn-style API. While there are a lot of
parameters to tweak, reading the documentation here should make the more
relevant ones clear for your problem.

``gplearn`` supports regression through the :class:`SymbolicRegressor`, binary
classification with the :class:`SymbolicClassifier`, as well as transformation
for automated feature engineering with the :class:`SymbolicTransformer`, which
is designed to support regression problems, but should also work for binary
classification.

``gplearn`` is built on scikit-learn and a fairly recent copy (0.20.0+) is required
for installation. If you come across any issues in running or installing the
package, `please submit a bug report <https://github.com/trevorstephens/gplearn/issues>`_.

Next up, read some more details about :ref:`what Genetic Programming is <intro>`,
and how it works...
