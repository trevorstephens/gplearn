Installation
============

`gplearn` requires a recent version of scikit-learn (which requires numpy and
scipy). So first you will need to `follow their installation instructions <http://scikit-learn.org/dev/install.html>`_
to get the dependencies.

Now that you have scikit-learn installed, you can install gplearn using pip::

    pip install gplearn

Or if you wish to install to the home directory::

    pip install --user gplearn

For the latest development version, first get the source from github::

    git clone https://github.com/trevorstephens/gplearn.git

Then navigate into the local `gplearn` directory and simply run::

    python setup.py install

or::

    python setup.py install --user

and you're done!
